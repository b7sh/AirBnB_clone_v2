> What are web frameworks and why you need them?

- Web applications have evolved at a rate that the usability and interactivity they provide rival that of a native application. The technology and the expertise needed to build tailored solutions that reach this level of proficiency is demanding. Thankfully, there are tools that make web application development easier, one of them being a web app framework.

- Here we look into what constitutes a web application framework and why you need it.

> What are web application frameworks?

- GeeksforGeeks describes ‘web application frameworks’ or ‘web frameworks’ as “a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”. In simple words, web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. Thus, you don’t need to code on your own and look for probable miscalculations and faults.

- In earlier days of web app development, web frameworks were introduced as a means to end hand-coding of applications where just the developer of a particular app could change it. That was long ago, now we have web-specific languages and the trouble with changing an app’s structure is resolved because of the arrival of a general performance. Now, depending upon your task you may choose one web framework that fulfills all your requirements or converges multiple frameworks.

> What is the difference between a CMS and a framework?

- Many find it difficult to differ the web app framework from CMS (Content Management System). When you are building a website or a web app the first thing you need is tools. You can create from scratch but not everyone is proficient in programming languages. CMS, in this case, relieves the stress of the need to have such expertise, meanwhile frameworks offer a set of features that you can use to create a custom application.

- The main difference between the two is the approach, like for instance, navigating your system through a command line (framework) vs an explorer (CMS). With CMS, you get pre-set features, consequently, you have an already styled theme for your website where you can add new features by installing the plugins. Complications may arise, however, if you need to make adjustments to your website as per your requirements.

- Meanwhile, with a framework, you have to create everything from scratch, but you can create unique features. Frameworks are highly customizable, whereas CMS typically have limitations. Plus, since web frameworks are usually a set of libraries and tools that help in building web apps, they require higher programming knowledge and skills.

- With CMS you don’t need to have programming skills, this is true, but that is only if you are maintaining a website that already exists. To set up a web app through a CMS you will at least need to know how to work with a server and how to read and edit pieces of code.

> Types of Web frameworks:

- As web standards began to advance, the app logic shifted towards the client- ensuring smarter communication between the user and the web application. With logic on client-side, they (client) can react swiftly to user input. This makes web apps more responsive, easily navigate-able on any device. Thus, we have two functions of frameworks — a) the one to work on the server side, that helps to set up app logic on the server (backend) or b) to work on the client-side (front end).
